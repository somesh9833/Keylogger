# Cybersecurity Capstone Project: Keylogger System

## Overview:
This repository contains the code and documentation for my cybersecurity capstone project, focusing on the development of a keylogger system. The keylogger system aims to enhance cybersecurity measures by monitoring and logging keystrokes, providing valuable insights into user activity and aiding in threat detection.

## Features:
- Real-time monitoring of keystrokes
- Secure storage and logging of captured keystrokes
- User-friendly interface for configuration and interaction
- Anomaly detection algorithms for identifying suspicious behavior
- Compatibility with various platforms and operating systems

To run this application , follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hariX02/keylogger.git
   cd keylogger
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install Pynput
   ```

3. Run the keylogger application:

   ```bash
   python keylogger.py
